The purpose of our project is to scrap all bike offers costing less than 150 â‚¬ from the French selling website www.paruvendu.fr .
We lost some teeth in the battle, our code is not the most optimal one, but we made sure for it to be readable and understable the easiest we could have done.
Please note that we could have done this same project for job offers, flat offers...etc. By the time we thought about these, we are already deep in our project.
