The purpose of our project is to scrap all bike offers costing less than 150 € from the French selling website www.paruvendu.fr .
We lost some teeth in the battle, our code is not the most optimal one, but we made sure for it to be readable and understable the easiest we could.
Please note that we could have done this same project for job offers, flat offers...etc. By the time we thought about these, we were already deep in it.

You could very well apply this code for yourself as long as you modify the adress mail "yass.ramil67@gmail.com" by putting your own email adress.
You should receive on a daily basis a table of all bikes costing less than 150 € on that email adress.

We didn't complete our project as we wished but we had fun doing it. 

Please note that you will receive the same table with same data as long as the articles haven't been modified from the website.
